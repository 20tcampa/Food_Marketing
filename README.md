# Food_Marketing
In this project, I took a food company's dataset that included demographic information, product sales information, and marketing campaign information. I took a deep dive into each of these categories to find trends and extract valuable insights. I then used Random Forest Regression and Grid-Search Cross Validation to predict if a customer would respond positively to a marketing campaign and used the feature_importance_ tool to find the most important variables for the predictive model. The model results had an accuracy of 79.3% with the most important feature being Wine purchases. Below I listed my findings for each catagory along with any suggestions that I have for optimizing sales and campaign efficiency.

Product Findings:
- Wine and Meats are the most commonly purchased items.
- In-Store purchases are the most common channels used.

Demographic Findings:
- The average customer is 55 years old and has a $52,000 yearly income.
- Most customers are Married and/or have an Undergraduate degree.
- There is a significant drop in average income and products purchased when Education is 'Basic'. 
- On average, Widows tend to buy more products than anyone else.
 
Campaign Findings:
- All campaigns combined had a success rate of 27.6%.
- The most successful campaign was campaign #6 with a 15.2% success rate.
- The least successful campaign was campaign #2 with a 1.3% success rate.
- Those who responded positively to a campaign made, on average, twice as many purchases compared to those who didn't respond positively to a campaign.
- Successful campaigns also showed an increase in Store, Catalog, and Web purchases by 16.97%, 48.59%, and 26.87% respectively.

When comparing successful vs unsuccessful campaign demographics, it showed that successful campaigns:
- Worked more frequently on those who had been customers for a longer period of time and those who made purchases more recently.
- Higher frequency of individuals who are Single, lower frequency on those who were Married or Together.
- Higher frequency of individuals with a PhD.
- Worked more frequently on those with less dependents in their household.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Fruits, Sweets, Gold Products, and Fish account for less than 25% of total profits. Possibly looking into what these products are and running promotions or deals or marketing campaigns for these products specifically could help increase sales.
- Look into aspects of Campaign #6 to find what made it so successful to use in later campaigns.
- Look into aspects of Campaign #2 to find what made it so unsuccessful to avoid for future campaigns.
- People who have been customers for longer responded more positively to campaigns. Spending time/money into customer retention strategies could be a good prove to be a good investment.
